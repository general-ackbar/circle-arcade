# Arcade Suite for Raspberry Pi

The Arcade Suite is built upon the Circle framework. To compile and set up the suite, follow the steps below. Circle is included as a submodule, but requires some initial setup.

## Prerequisites

- **Toolchain Requirements**:
  - For Raspberry Pi 1: ARM1176JZF core with EABI support.
  - For Raspberry Pi 2/3/4: Cortex-A7, A53, or A72 support.

A compatible toolchain can be downloaded from [here](#). Please make sure to install it before proceeding.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository with Submodules**:

   Clone the repository and initialize the submodules recursively.

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/yourusername/arcade-suite.git

2. **Build Circle Framework:

	Navigate to the Circle submodule directory and build it. For the Raspberry Pi 1, you don't need to alter the default settings.
	
	```bash
	cd arcade-suite/circle
	./configure
	make all
	
For more details and options, refer to the README file in the Circle submodule directory or the original Circle repository.

3. ** Compile the SDCard Addon:

	Navigate to the SDCard addon directory and compile it.

	```bash
	cd addon/SDCard
	make

4. ***Build the Arcade Suite:

	Return to the root directory of the project and build the entire suite.

	```bash
	cd ../../
	make

This should generate a kernel.img file.

##  Final Steps

1. ** Prepare the SD Card:

Copy kernel.img along with the necessary boot files to a FAT32 formatted SD card. For Raspberry Pi 1, the required boot files are:

bootcode.bin
fixup.dat
start.elf
Refer to the Circle project's documentation for more details.
