# Arcade Suite for Raspberry Pi

The Arcade Suite consist of 4 classic retro games: Tetris, Space Invaders, Snake and Pong and a simple menu. The games are built using Circle - a C++ bare metal programming environment for the Raspberry Pi.
To compile and set up the suite, follow the steps below. Circle is included as a submodule, but requires some initial setup.

The games themselves are pretty straight forward and it should be fairy easy to expand or modify them. If you wish to change or add new adio or graphics you need to comply to a few constraints. The audio must be exported as raw (headerless),signed 16-bit PCM data using e.i. Audacity. The graphics are loaded as rgb565 LMI files (see #https://github.com/general-ackbar/lmiencoder).

This version is optimized for the Raspberry Pi 1, using one USB-controller. Video output through either composite or HDMI and audio through jack.

## Prerequisites

- **Toolchain Requirements**:
  - For Raspberry Pi 1: [ARM1176JZF core with EABI support](#http://elinux.org/Rpi_Software#ARM)
  - For Raspberry Pi 2/3/4: [Cortex-A7, A53, or A72 support](#https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)

   Please make sure to install it before proceeding.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository with Submodules**:

   Clone the repository and initialize the submodules recursively.

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/general-ackbar/circle-arcade.git

2. Build Circle Framework:

	Navigate to the Circle submodule directory and build it. For the Raspberry Pi 1, you don't need to alter the default settings.
	
	```bash
	cd arcade-suite/circle
	./configure
	make all
	```
	
   For more details and options, refer to the README file in the Circle submodule directory or the original Circle repository.

3. Compile the SDCard Addon:

	Navigate to the SDCard addon directory and compile it.

	```bash
	cd addon/SDCard
	make
	

## Build the Arcade Suite:

1.  Return to the root directory of the project and build the entire suite.

    ```bash
	cd ../../
	make
    ```
   This should generate a kernel.img file.

##  Final Steps

1. Copy kernel.img to a FAT32 formatted SD card.

2. Copy the necessary boot files to the SD card

    For Raspberry Pi 1, the required boot files are:
    * bootcode.bin
    * fixup.dat
    * start.elf
 
   Refer to the Circle project's documentation for more details.
3. Edit or create a config.txt file in the SD card root specifying the resolution
	```bash
	width=640 height=480
	```
	
4. Eject SD card, plug it in the RPI, attach a controller and have fun :)
